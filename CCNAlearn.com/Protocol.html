        <h1 style="align-text:center;">Protocols</h1>
       <h3>USB  Physical layer</h3>
     <p href ="#USB">  USB is an interface that connects a device to a computer. With this connection, the computer sends or retrieves data
from the device. USB gives developers a standard interface to use in many different types of applications. A USB
device is easy to connect and use because of a systematic design process. This application note is intended to help
make that process simpler.</p>
           <h3>Ethernet </h3>
           <p>The Ethernet physical layer is the physical layer component of the Ethernet family of computer network standards which defines the electrical or optical properties of the physical connection between a device and the network or between network devices. It is complemented by the MAC layer and the logical link layer which provide features like framing, addressing, checksums, virtual LANs, and link aggregation.

The Ethernet physical layer has evolved over its existence starting in 1980 and encompasses multiple physical media interfaces and several orders of magnitude of speed. The speed ranges from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Gbit/s, while the physical medium can range from bulky coaxial cable to twisted pair and optical fiber. In general, network protocol stack software will work similarly on all physical layers.

</p>
           <h3>DSL</h3>
           <p><strong>Digital subscriber line</strong> (DSL; originally digital subscriber loop) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines. In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for Internet access. DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line. This is possible because DSL uses higher frequency bands for data. On the customer premises, a DSL filter on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.</p>
<h3>ISDN</h3>
           <p><strong>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)</strong> is a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network.</p>
           <h3>Bluetooth physical layer</h3>
           <p><strong>Bluetooth </strong>is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994,it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.</p>
           <h3>CDP(Cisco Discovery Protocol)</h3>
           <p><strong>Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)</strong> is a proprietary Data Link Layer protocol developed by Cisco Systems. It is used to share information about other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as the operating system version and IP address. 
        CDP can also be used for On-Demand Routing, which is a method of including routing information in CDP announcements so that dynamic routing protocols do not need to be used in simple networks.</p>
           <h3>CHAP</h3>
           <p> Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authenticates a user or network host to an authenticating entity. That entity may be, for example, an Internet service provider. CHAP is specified in RFC 1994.<br>
             CHAP provides protection against replay attacks by the peer through the use of an incrementally changing identifier and of a variable challenge-value. CHAP requires that both the client and server know the plaintext of the secret, although it is never sent over the network. Thus, CHAP provides better security as compared to Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) which is vulnerable for both these reasons. The MS-CHAP variant does not require either peer to know the plaintext and does not transmit it, but has been broken<br>
           CHAP is an authentication scheme used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) servers to validate the identity of remote clients. CHAP periodically verifies the identity of the client by using a three-way handshake. This happens at the time of establishing the initial link (LCP), and may happen again at any time afterwards. The verification is based on a shared secret (such as the client's password).<br>
</p>
      <h3>Frame Relay</h3> 
           <p>Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network technology that specifies the physical and data link layers of digital telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology. Originally designed for transport across Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) infrastructure, it may be used today in the context of many other network interfaces.</p>
           <h3>HDLC</h3>
           <p>The HDLC protocol is a general purpose protocol which operates at the data link layer of the OSI reference model. The protocol uses the services of a physical layer, and provides either a best effort or reliable communications path between the transmitter and receiver (i.e. with acknowledged data transfer).</p>
           <h3>IEEE 802.11</h3>
           <p>IEEE 802.11 is a set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the 900 MHz and 2.4, 3.6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands. They are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.</p>
            <h3>LLC</h3>
           <p>In the IEEE 802 reference model of computer networking, the logical link control (LLC) data communication protocol layer is the upper sublayer of the data link layer (layer 2) of the seven-layer OSI model. The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing mechanisms that make it possible for several network protocols (e.g. IP, IPX, Decnet and Appletalk) to coexist within a multipoint network and to be transported over the same network medium. It can also provide flow control and automatic repeat request (ARQ) error management mechanisms.<br><br>
The LLC sublayer acts as an interface between the media access control (MAC) sublayer and the network layer</p>
           <h3>LACP</h3>
           <p>The LACP (802.3ad) for Gigabit Interfaces feature bundles individual Gigabit Ethernet links into a single logical link that provides the aggregate bandwidth of up to 4 physical links. A Cisco 10000 series router supports a maximum of 4 Gigabit Ethernet bundled ports per port channel and a maximum of 64 Gigabit Ethernet port channels per chassis.
All LAN ports on a port channel must be the same speed and must all be configured as either Layer 2 or Layer 3 LAN ports. If a segment within a port channel fails, traffic previously carried over the failed link switches to the remaining segments within the port channel. Inbound broadcast and multicast packets on one segment in a port channel are blocked from returning on any other segment of the port channel.</p>
           <h3>LCP</h3>
           <p >Link Control Protocol (LCP) forms part of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), within the family of Internet protocols. In setting up PPP communications, both the sending and receiving devices send out LCP packets to determine the standards of the ensuing data transmission.<br><br>
The LCP protocol:<br><br>

checks the identity of the linked device and either accepts or rejects the device<br><br>
determines the acceptable packet size for transmission<br><br>
searches for errors in configuration<br><br>
can terminate the link if requirements exceed the parameters<br><br>
Devices cannot use PPP to transmit data over a network until the LCP packet determines the acceptability of the link, but LCP packets are embedded into PPP packets and therefore a basic PPP connection has to be established before LCP can reconfigure it. The LCP over PPP packets have control code 0xC021 and their info field contains the LCP packet, which has four fields (Code, ID, Length and Data).<br><br>

Code: Operation requested: configure link, terminate link, ... and acknowledge and deny codes.<br><br>
Data: Parameters for the operation.</p>
           <h3>MAC</h3>
           <p>Medium Access Control (MAC) The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is used to provide the data link layer of the Ethernet LAN system.</p>
           <h3>PAgP</h3>
           <p>Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is a Cisco Systems proprietary networking protocol, which is used for the automated, logical aggregation of Ethernet switch ports, known as an ether channel. The PAgP is proprietary to Cisco Systems. A similar protocol known as LACP— released by the IEEE and known as 802.3ad or 802.1ax recently — is an industry standard and is not tied to a specific vendor.</p>
           <h3>PPP</h3>
           <p> Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer (layer 2) communications protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes. It connects two routers directly without any host or any other networking device in between. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption, and compression.

PPP is used over many types of physical networks including serial cable, phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, specialized radio links, and fiber optic links such as SONET. Internet service providers (ISPs) have used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet, since IP packets cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own, without some data link protocol.</p>
           <h3>STP</h3>
           <p> Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a logical loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup links to provide fault tolerance if an active link fails. This is done without the danger of bridge loops, or the need for manual enabling or disabling of these backup links.</p>
           <h3>VTP</h3>
<p>VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that propagates the definition of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) on the whole local area network.[1] To do this, VTP carries VLAN information to all the switches in a VTP domain. VTP advertisements can be sent over 802.1Q, and ISL trunks. VTP is available on most of the Cisco Catalyst Family products. Using VTP, each Catalyst Family Switch advertises the following on its trunk ports:<br>

Management domain<br>
Configuration revision number<br>
Known VLANs and their specific parameters<br></p> 
       <h3>VLAN</h3>
           <p>VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that propagates the definition of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) on the whole local area network. To do this, VTP carries VLAN information to all the switches in a VTP domain. VTP advertisements can be sent over 802.1Q, and ISL trunks.</p>
           <h3>ARP</h3>
           <p> Address resolution protocol (arp) is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP) [RFC826], specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. The protocol operates below the network layer as a part of the interface between the OSI network and OSI link layer.</p>
           <h3>RARP</h3>
           <p> Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer networking protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address. The client broadcasts the request, and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request.</p>
           <h3>Anti-Replay</h3>
           <p>Anti-replay is a sub-protocol of IPsec that is part of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The main goal of anti-replay is to avoid hackers injecting or making changes in packets that travel from a source to a destination.</p>
           <h3>ATM</h3>
           <p>Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is, according to the ATM Forum, "a telecommunications concept defined by ANSI and ITU (formerly CCITT) standards for carriage of a complete range of user traffic, including voice, data, and video signals"</p>
           <h3>EIGRP</h3>
           <p>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol that is used on a computer network for automating routing decisions and configuration. The protocol was designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on Cisco routers.</p>
           <h3>GRE</h3>
           <p>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco Systems that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol network.</p>
           <h3>GLBP</h3>
           <p>Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that attempts to overcome the limitations of existing redundant router protocols by adding basic load balancing functionality.</p>
           <h3>HSRP</h3>
           <p>Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway. Version 1 of the protocol was described in RFC 2281.</p>
           <h3>RIP</h3>
           <p> Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination.</p>
           <h3>RIP v2</h3>
           <p> RIP version 2 (RIPv2) was developed in 1993[4] and last standardized in 1998.[4] It included the ability to carry subnet information, thus supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).</p>
           <h3>IGRP</h3>
           <p>Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a distance vector interior gateway protocol (IGP) developed by Cisco. It is used by routers to exchange routing data within an autonomous system. IGRP is a proprietary protocol.</p>
           <h3>ICMP</h3>
           <p>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.</p>
           <h3>IGMP</h3>

           <h3>NAT</h3>
           <p>Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in Internet Protocol (IP) datagram packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device</p>
           <h3>OSPF</h3>
           <p>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS). It is defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4.</p>
           <h3>VRRP</h3>
           <p>Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a computer networking protocol that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol (IP) routers to participating hosts. This increases the availability and reliability of routing paths via automatic default gateway selections on an IP subnetwork.</p>
           <h3>BGP</h3>
           <p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. The protocol is often classified as a path vector protocol but is sometimes also classed as a distance-vector routing protocol.</p>
           <h3>DNS</h3>
           <p>Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network</p>
           <h3>DHCP</h3>
           <p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a standardized network protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The DHCP is controlled by a DHCP server that dynamically distributes network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses, for interfaces and services.</p>
           <h3>FTP</h3>
           <p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.</p>
           <h3>HTTP</h3>
           <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</p>
           <h3>HTTPS</h3>
           <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.</p>
           <h3>NTP</h3>
           <p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.</p>
           <h3>POP3</h3>
           <p> Post Office Protocol (POP) is an application-layer Internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection.</p>
           <h3>SSH</h3>
           <p>SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections; it can transfer files using the associated SSH file transfer (SFTP) or secure copy (SCP) protocols. SSH uses the client-server model.</p>
           <h3>SMTP</h3>
           <p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (email) transmission. First defined by RFC 821 in 1982, it was last updated in 2008 with Extended SMTP additions by RFC 5321, which is the protocol in widespread use today.</p>
           <h3>Telnet</h3>
           <p>Telnet is a protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</p>
           <h3>TFTP</h3>
           <p>Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is an Internet software utility for transferring files that is simpler to use than the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) but less capable. It is used where user authentication and directory visibility are not required.</p>
           <h3>URL</h3>
           <p>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a resource.

Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.</p>
